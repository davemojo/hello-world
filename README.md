# hello-world

This is my first project - a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python.

I'm trying to go back to my developer roots. I've strayed for many years and am now a technical nube.

## Project Structure

```
hello-world/
├── src/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── hello.py          # Main hello world program
├── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies (currently empty)
├── .gitignore           # Git ignore patterns
├── efficiency_report.md # Analysis of efficiency improvements
└── README.md           # This file
```

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Running the Program

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd hello-world

# Run the hello world program
python3 src/hello.py
```

Expected output:
```
Hello, World!
```

## Development

This project follows Python best practices with a clean directory structure. The main program is located in the `src/` directory to separate source code from configuration files.

### Installing Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Currently, no external dependencies are required for this simple hello world program.
